# Explore the Data {#explore-data}

## Pull the Data

The first thing we will need to do is download the latest data. We will do this by using the `pins` package [@R-pins], which has already been loaded into our session [in the previous section](#installing-and-loading-packages).

First, we will need to connect to a public GitHub repository (anyone can post their code to the GitHub website and make a "repository" with code for their project) and ***register*** the ***board*** that the data is ***pinned*** to by using the **`board_register()`** function:

```{r hitBTC_register}
board_register(name = "pins_board", url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/predictcrypto/pins/master/", board = "datatxt")
```

By running the `board_register()` command on the URL where the data is located, we can now ***"ask"*** for the data we are interested in, which is called `hitBTC_orderbook`:

```{r pull_data, eval=FALSE}
cryptodata <- pin_get(name = "hitBTC_orderbook")
```

<!-- Couldn't hide the progress bar so had to split it into a hidden code chunk instead -->

```{r pull_data_hidden_exec, include=FALSE}
cryptodata <- pin_get(name = "hitBTC_orderbook")
```

The data has been saved to the `cryptodata` object.

## Data Preview {#data-preview}

```{r disable_scientific_notation, include=F}
options(scipen=999)
```

Below is a preview of the data:

```{r show_cryptodata, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(head(cryptodata, 2000),  style = "default", 
          options = list(scrollX = TRUE, pageLength=3, lengthMenu = c(3, 5, 10)), rownames = F)
```

*Only the first 2,000 rows of the data are shown in the table above. There are `r nrow(cryptodata)` rows in the actual full dataset. The latest data is from `r max(cryptodata$date, na.rm =T )`.*

This is [***tidy data***](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html), meaning:

1.  Every column is a variable.

2.  Every row is an observation.

3.  Every cell is a single value relating to a specific variable and observation.

The data is collected once per hour. Each row is an observation of an individual cryptocurrency, and the same cryptocurrency is tracked on an hourly basis, each time presented as a new row in the dataset.

## The definition of a "price" {#the-definition-of-a-price}

When we are talking about the price of a cryptocurrency, there are several different ways to define it. Most people check cryptocurrency prices on websites that aggregate data across thousands of exchanges, and have ways of computing a global average that represents the current price of the cryptocurrency. This is what happens on the very popular website coinmarketcap.com, but is this the correct approach for our use case?

Before we even start programming, a crucial step of any successful predictive modeling process is defining the problem in a way that makes sense in relation to the actions we are looking to take. If we are looking to trade a specific cryptocurrency on a specific exchange, using the global average price is not going to be the best approach because we might create a model that believes we could have traded at certain prices when this was actually not the case. If this was the only data available we could certainly try and extrapolate trends across all exchanges and countries, but a better alternative available to us is to define the price as the price that we could have **actually purchased** the cryptocurrency at. If we are interested in purchasing a cryptocurrency, we should consider data for the price we could have actually purchased it at.

The way these markets work, is you have a constantly evolving [[***order book***]{style="color: purple;"}](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp), where traders can post specific trades they want to make to either sell or buy a cryptocurrency specifying the price and quantity. When someone posts a trade to sell a cryptocurrency at a price that someone else is looking to purchase it at, a trade between the two parties will take place.

You can find an example of a live order book for the exchange we will be using here: <https://hitbtc.com/btc-to-usdt>

Scroll down to view the information relating to the orderbooks: ![](images/orderbook_ex.PNG)

<!-- [TODO - FINISH THIS] -->

Let's focus on the **Market Depth Chart** for now: ![](images/market_depth_chart.PNG)

Here, the x-axis shows the price of the cryptocurrency, with the lower prices on the left and the higher ones on the right, while the y-axis shows the cumulative volume (here in terms of Bitcoins) of orders that could currently be triggered on each side.

In the screenshot above, around the \$13,000 price point the market essentially "runs out" of people willing to buy the cryptocurrency, and shows us how much people are willing to sell at the higher price points. The screenshot shows there are many orders that are waiting to be fulfilled, around the \$12,500 price point shown for example the chart tells us if we wanted to buy the cryptocurrency BTC at that price, about 1,500 BTC would have to be sold for more expensive prices before the order was triggered. The market will aggregate trades people want to perform based on the given prices, and fulfill orders from the orderbook of pending trades. The price at which the two sides of the orderbook converge is the price we could currently trade the cryptocurrency on this exchange at.

Because the price works this way, we couldn't simply buy 1,500 BTC at the \$13,000 price point because we would run out of people who are willing to sell their BTC at that price point, and to fulfill the entire order we would need to pay more than what we would consider to be the "price" depending on how much we were looking to purchase. **This is one of the many reasons for why any positive results shown here wouldn't necessarily produce an effective trading strategy if put into practice in the real world. There is a meaningful difference between predicting price movements for the cryptocurrency markets, and actually performing effective trades, so please just have fun and experiment with the data but hold back the urge to use this to perform real trades**.

### In Summary

To summarize the implications of what was explained above, the data we are using gives us the 5 nearest prices on both sides of where the red and green lines connect on the Market Depth Chart, as well as the quantity available to purchase or sell at that given price point.

In order to make predictive models to predict the price of a cryptocurrency, we will first need to define the price as the lowest available price that allows us to buy "enough" of it based on the current orderbook data as described above.

## Data Quality {#data-quality}

Before jumping into actually cleaning your data, it's worth spending time doing some [**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**]{style="color: purple;"}, which is the process of analyzing the data itself for issues before starting on any other process. Most data science and business problems will require you to have a deep understanding of your dataset and all of its caveats and issues, and without those fundamental problems understood and accounted for no model will make sense. In our case this understanding mostly comes from understanding how the price of a cryptocurrency is defined, which [we reviewed above](#the-definition-of-a-price), and there isn't too much else for us to worry about in terms of the quality of the raw data, but in other cases doing EDA will be a more involved process doing things like visualizing the different columns of the data. There are a *lot* of tools that can be used for this, but as an example we can use one of the [packages we already imported into the R session in the setup section](#installing-and-loading-packages) called [**skimr**]{style="color: orange;"} to get a quick overview/summary of the "quality" of the different columns that make up the data.

We can use the [**skim()**]{style="color: green;"} function on the `cryptodata` dataframe to get a summary of the data to help locate any potential data quality issues:

```{r skimr}
skim(cryptodata)
```

This summary helps us understand things like how many null values are present in a given column and how those values are distributed. In this case there shouldn't be any major data quality issues, for example the majority of values should not be NA/missing. If you are noticing something different 

Move on to the [next section](#data-prep), where we make the adjustments necessary to the data before we can start making visualizations and predictive models.
