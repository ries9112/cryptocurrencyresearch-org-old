[["index.html", "Cryptocurrency Research Section - 1 Introduction 1.1 What will I learn? 1.2 Before Getting Started 1.3 Who is this example for? 1.4 Format Notes 1.5 Plan of Attack 1.6 Disclaimer", " Cryptocurrency Research Last Updated: 2020-10-25 17:06:24 Section - 1 Introduction (this book is a work in progress and is NOT ready) 1.1 What will I learn? In this tutorial you will primarily learn about tools for the R programming language developed by RStudio and more specifically the tidyverse. If you are not familiar with these open source products, don’t worry. We’ll introduce these throughout the tutorial as needed. The focus of the tutorial is on supervised machine learning, a process for building models that can predict future events, such as cryptocurrency prices. You will learn how to use the caret package to make many different predictive models, and tools to evaluate their performance. You will learn how to perform “group by” operations on your data using the dplyr package. You will be exposed to some very useful data pre-processing R packages, including skimr, janitor and anytime. You will learn about some powerful extensions to the ggplot2 visualization framework. You will gain a better understanding of the steps involved in any supervised machine learning process, as well considerations you might need to keep in mind based on your specific data and the way you plan on acting on the predictions you have made. Each problem comes with a unique set of challenges, but there are steps that are necessary in creating any supervised machine learning model, and questions you should ask yourself regardless of the specific problem at hand. You will also learn a little about cryptocurrencies themselves, but this is not a tutorial around blockchain itself or trading. 1.2 Before Getting Started There are two different versions of this tutorial, one high-level, accessible version and one detailed, code-heavy version. We recommend you start with the high-level version of the tutorial (#1 below): The high-level version of this tutorial simplifies the supervised machine learning process as much as possible and provides a high-level framework that can be used for most supervised learning problems. When following along with this example, the results will be completely reproducible and the document is static and does not update over time. Even if your intent is to appropriate all the knowledge of the detailed tutorial, consider doing this tutorial first. The detailed tutorial is the document you are currently looking at, and is a full example showing one possible approach to making predictions on the cryptocurrency markets. Here we discuss the nuances that are specific to our data and problem. We focus on the supervised machine learning process and modeling many cryptocurrencies at once rather than real trades on these markets. This entire document and results are updated twice daily with the latest data. 1.3 Who is this example for? Are you a Bob, Hosung, or Jessica? This section provides more information on how to proceed with this tutorial. Bob (beginner): Bob is someone who understands the idea of predictive analytics at a high level and has heard of cryptocurrencies and is interested in learning more about both, but he has never used R. Bob would want to first learn the basics of the R programming language. Afterwards, like Hosung, he might decide to opt for the more high-level version of this tutorial. Bob might benefit from the book “R for Data Science” and DataCamp’s free “Introduction to R” course are great resources as well. Both are available for free online. Hosung (intermediate): Hosung is a statistician who learned to use R 10 years ago. He has heard of the tidyverse, but doesn’t regularly use it in his work and he usually sticks to base R as his preference. Hosung should review the example explaining the pipe operator and the tidyverse when it comes up in the next section. Hosung does not care much for cryptocurrencies specifically, but is interested in learning new tools to use for his work in R and getting some useful boilerplate code. Hosung would want to start with the high-level version of this tutorial and later return to the detailed tutorial. Jessica (expert): Jessica is a business analyst who has experience with both R and the Tidyverse and uses the pipe operator (%&gt;%) regularly. Jessica should move onto the next section for the detailed tutorial. 1.4 Format Notes You can hide the sidebar on the left by pressing the s key on your keyboard. When the code is highlighted this way, that means we are referencing an R object of some kind. This will usually be an object in the R session like a dataset, but functions and packages are highlighted in the same way. The cryptocurrency data was chosen to produce results that change over time and because these markets don’t have any downtime (unlike the stock market). 1.5 Plan of Attack How will we generate predictive models to predict cryptocurrency prices? At a high level, here are the steps we will be taking: Setup guide. Installation guide on getting the tools used installed on your machine. Explore data. What is the data we are working with? How “good” is the “quality”? Prepare the data. Make adjustments to “clean” the data based on the findings from the previous section to avoid running into problems when making models to make predictions. Visualize the data. Visualizing the data can be an effective way to understand relationships, trends and outliers before creating predictive models. Make predictive models. Now we are ready to take the data available to us and use it to make predictive models that can be used to make predictions about future price movements using the latest data. Evaluate the performance of the models. Before we can use the predictive models to make predictions on the latest data, we need to understand how well we expect them to perform, which is also essential in detecting issues. 1.6 Disclaimer This tutorial is made available for learning and educational purposes only and the information to follow does not constitute trading advice in any way shape or form. We avoid giving any advice when it comes to trading strategies, as this is a very complex ecosystem that is out of the scope of this tutorial; we make no attempt in this regard, and if this, rather than data science, is your interest, your time would be better spent following a different tutorial that aims to answer those questions. "],["setup.html", "Section - 2 Setup and Installation 2.1 Option 1 - Run in the Cloud 2.2 Option 2 - Run Locally 2.3 Installing and Loading Packages", " Section - 2 Setup and Installation You can follow the tutorial without coding. In that case, you can move on to the next page where the tutorial actually begins. 2.1 Option 1 - Run in the Cloud If you do not currently have R and RStudio installed on your computer, you can run all of the code in a jupyter notebook using an R kernel that we have made available online in this mobile friendly link. This can take up to 30 seconds to load, and once it has you should see a page that looks like this: From here, you can run the code one cell at a time: You can also use Shift + Enter to run an individual code cell Or run all code cells at once (recommended): If you feel lost, you can do a quick interactive walkthrough under Help –&gt; User Interface Tour: 2.2 Option 2 - Run Locally If you want to follow along from your own computer directly (recommended option), please follow the installation instructions below. Afterwards, you will be able to run the code. You only need to follow these instructions once. If you have followed these steps once already, skip ahead to the next section. 2.2.1 Setup R Hopefully you already have R and RStudio installed on your computer. If you don’t have these two programs installed, you will need to: Install R. Install RStudio. This step is optional, but it is very recommended that you use an integrated development environment (IDE) like RStudio as you follow along, rather than using the R console as it was installed in step 1 above. 2.3 Installing and Loading Packages [ADD HERE] describe how to install packages, what they are, etc… like high-level version. install.packages(&#39;pacman&#39;) Load pacman: library(pacman) Install other packages: p_load(&#39;pins&#39;,&#39;tidyverse&#39;,&#39;skimr&#39;,&#39;tsibble&#39;,&#39;doParallel&#39;,&#39;DT&#39;, &#39;caret&#39;,&#39;anytime&#39;,&#39;gganimate&#39;,&#39;tictoc&#39;,&#39;gifski&#39;, &#39;xgboost&#39;,&#39;gbm&#39;,&#39;rayshader&#39;, &#39;rgl&#39;, &#39;ggthemes&#39;,&#39;ggTimeSeries&#39;, &#39;av&#39;,&#39;magick&#39;) ## ## The downloaded binary packages are in ## /var/folders/24/8k48jl6d249_n_qfxwsl6xvm0000gn/T//RtmpG7C6iB/downloaded_packages ## ## The downloaded binary packages are in ## /var/folders/24/8k48jl6d249_n_qfxwsl6xvm0000gn/T//RtmpG7C6iB/downloaded_packages Nice work!

We will do this by using the pins package (Luraschi 2020), which has already been loaded into our session in the previous section. First, we will need to connect to a public GitHub repository (anyone can post their code to the GitHub website and make a “repository” with code for their project) and register the board that the data is pinned to by using the board_register() function: board_register(name = &quot;pins_board&quot;, url = &quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/predictcrypto/pins/master/&quot;, board = &quot;datatxt&quot;) By running the board_register() command on the URL where the data is located, we can now “ask” for the data we are interested in, which is called hitBTC_orderbook: cryptodata

object. 3.2 Data Preview Below is a preview of the data: This is tidy data, meaning: Every column is a variable. Every row is an observation. Every cell is a single value. The data is collected once per hour and includes 120 days worth of data relative to today’s date. Each row is an observation of an individual cryptocurrency, and the same cryptocurrency is tracked on an hourly basis, each time presented as a new row in the dataset. Only the first 2,000 rows of the data are shown in the table above. There are 193537 rows in the actual full dataset. The latest data is from 2020-10-25. 3.3 The definition of a “price” [ADD HERE ABOUT ORDERBOOKS VS. PRICE SHOWN ON A WEBSITE] The price of a cryptocurrency on an exchange is given by the order book, where traders can post trades they want to perform. [KEEP ADDING HERE] 3.4 Data Quality First, let us get a general overview of the data to confirm there are no major data quality issues. There are several ways to do this, including using base R functions (base R meaning anything that comes with the default installation of R when you start up a new session), but we will use the skimr(Waring et al. 2020) package to get a nicely formatted output. We can use skim() on the cryptodata dataframe to get a summary of the data to help locate any potential problems: skim(cryptodata) Table 3.1: Data summary Name cryptodata Number of rows 193537 Number of columns 27 _______________________ Column type frequency: character 5 Date 1 numeric 20 POSIXct 1 ________________________ Group variables Variable type: character skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min max empty n_unique whitespace pair 0 1 5 9 0 210 0 symbol 0 1 2 6 0 210 0 quote_currency 0 1 3 3 0 1 0 pkDummy 379 1 13 13 0 1832 0 pkey 379 1 15 19 0 192878 0 Variable type: Date skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min max median n_unique date 379 1 2020-08-10 2020-10-25 2020-09-18 77 Variable type: numeric skim_variable n_missing complete_rate mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 hist ask_1_price 43 1 260.93 8926.78 0 0.01 0.06 0.63 999999.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_1_quantity 43 1 218802.17 5355022.60 0 18.00 426.00 3620.00 455776000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_2_price 81 1 240.39 7684.95 0 0.01 0.06 0.64 999999.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_2_quantity 81 1 226841.12 4396104.39 0 20.00 448.79 5000.00 331298000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_3_price 155 1 261.29 8517.36 0 0.01 0.06 0.66 999000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_3_quantity 155 1 282549.94 4910456.26 0 14.00 400.00 7000.00 518082000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_4_price 186 1 199.27 5254.76 0 0.01 0.07 0.70 999000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_4_quantity 186 1 310997.75 5297581.97 0 12.00 419.60 7580.00 546546000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_5_price 202 1 173.73 1347.93 0 0.01 0.07 0.72 20523.8 ▇▁▁▁▁ ask_5_quantity 202 1 319312.24 5684659.85 0 12.20 433.30 8735.00 549312000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_1_price 218 1 171.01 1337.27 0 0.00 0.05 0.56 20298.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_1_quantity 218 1 163369.35 2586180.29 0 30.00 671.90 7880.00 282300000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_2_price 277 1 170.84 1336.71 0 0.00 0.05 0.56 20269.5 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_2_quantity 277 1 168795.89 3193336.06 0 21.00 482.00 6070.00 562697873.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_3_price 279 1 170.51 1335.82 0 0.00 0.05 0.55 20231.5 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_3_quantity 279 1 231068.15 3288811.72 0 12.00 376.60 6012.92 347366000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_4_price 279 1 170.13 1334.81 0 0.00 0.04 0.53 20227.4 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_4_quantity 279 1 291789.79 3533897.87 0 10.00 380.00 7320.00 331285000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_5_price 280 1 169.59 1332.97 0 0.00 0.04 0.51 20210.4 ▇▁▁▁▁ bid_5_quantity 280 1 352730.86 4512390.27 0 10.00 380.00 8400.00 384159000.0 ▇▁▁▁▁ Variable type: POSIXct skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min max median n_unique date_time_utc 379 1 2020-08-10 04:29:09 2020-10-25 17:03:21 2020-09-18 12:02:08 178528 Move on to the next section, where we make the adjustments necessary to the data before we can start making visualizations and predictive models.

The data is tied to its groupings when performing all operations until we use ungroup() to undo them. Let’s add the new split column to the way the data is grouped: cryptodata &lt;- group_by(cryptodata, symbol, split) The new field split, helps us split the data into 5 different datasets based on the date, and contains a number from 1-5. The new field training flags the data as being part of the train dataset, or the test (or holdout for the first split) dataset for each of the 5 splits/datasets. Running the same code as before with tail() added, we should see rows associated with the test data of the 5th split (again remember, each of the 5 splits has a training and testing dataset): tail( select(cryptodata, training, split) ) ## [90m# A tibble: 6 x 3[39m ## [90m# Groups: symbol, split [6][39m ## symbol training split ## [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m ## [90m1[39m REP holdout 5 ## [90m2[39m DRT holdout 5 ## [90m3[39m DAY holdout 5 ## [90m4[39m NUT holdout 5 ## [90m5[39m UTT holdout 5 ## [90m6[39m DCN holdout 5 The easiest way to understand these groupings, is to visualize them. In the next section, you will learn powerful tools for visualizing data in R. Do not worry if you do not understand the code below and are not familiar with ggplot(), we will explain this framework in the next section, for now review the charts below and try to follow along with the way we are grouping the data for the predictive models by looking at what the x and y axis represent, as well as the colors. On the x-axis we are plotting the DateTime of when a data point was collected, and on the y-axis the split (1-5) as described in this section. The data is then colored based on the category assigned for the training variable (“train”,“test” or “holdout”). We can visualize the new grouping variables: groups_chart &lt;- ggplot(cryptodata, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = split, color = training)) + geom_point() #+ #scale_y_reverse() # now show the chart we just saved: groups_chart We can check on the groupings for each cryptocurrency by animating the previous chart: library(gganimate) animated_chart &lt;- groups_chart + transition_states(symbol) + ggtitle(&#39;Now showing: {closest_state}&#39;) # show the new animated chart animate(animated_chart, fps = 2) If/when need to slow these down, use this code: (can’t change fps from 1 - or at least be careful, it’s error prone) animate(animated_chart, fps = 1) This is another tool that we will walk through in the next section. It can be a bit hard to tell how many data points there are because they end up looking like lines. Let’s change the plot to use geom_jitter() instead of geom_point(), which will manually offset the points and let us see exactly how many data points there are: animated_chart &lt;- animated_chart + geom_jitter() # show the new animated chart animate(animated_chart, fps = 2) 4.6 Fix Data by Split Now that we have split the data into many different subsets, those subsets themselves may have issues that prevent the predictive models from working as expected. 4.6.1 Zero Variance One of the first models we will make is a simple linear model. The regular R function for this will not work if the data contains any columns that have “zero variance”, meaning the value of the column never changes throughout the data being given to the model. Therefore, let’s fix any issues relating to zero variance columns in any dataset before we change the structure of the data in the step after this one. First change the grouping of the data, we are interested in calculating the zero variance based on the symbol, split and training fields. cryptodata &lt;- group_by(cryptodata, symbol, split, training) Now let’s create a new object called find_zero_var which shows the value of the minimum standard deviation across all columns and calculated based on the grouping of symbol, split and train. find_zero_var &lt;- select(mutate(cryptodata, min_sd = min(sd(price_usd, na.rm=T), sd(target_price_24h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_1h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_2h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_3h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_6h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_12h, na.rm=T), sd(lagged_price_24h, na.rm=T))), min_sd) # Show data find_zero_var ## [90m# A tibble: 125,911 x 4[39m ## [90m# Groups: symbol, split, training [1,090][39m ## symbol split training min_sd ## [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m ## [90m 1[39m XTZ 1 train 0.114 ## [90m 2[39m BCH 1 train 9.38 ## [90m 3[39m BNB 1 train 0.799 ## [90m 4[39m ETC 1 train 0.259 ## [90m 5[39m NEO 1 train 0.582 ## [90m 6[39m LEO 1 train 0.115 ## [90m 7[39m STX 1 train 0.000[4m5[24m[4m0[24m[4m2[24m ## [90m 8[39m GBX 1 train 0.002[4m5[24m[4m6[24m ## [90m 9[39m ACT 1 train 0.000[4m6[24m[4m7[24m[4m2[24m ## [90m10[39m MBL 1 train 0.000[4m0[24m[4m0[24m[4m5[24m96 ## [90m# … with 125,901 more rows[39m Now let’s get to a list of cryptocurrency symbols where the minimum standard deviation across all columns for all splits of the data is 0. minimum_sd &lt;- filter(distinct(mutate(group_by(ungroup(find_zero_var), symbol), min_sd = min(min_sd, na.rm=T)), min_sd),min_sd &lt; 0.000001)$symbol # Show result minimum_sd ## [1] &quot;LEO&quot; &quot;GBX&quot; &quot;ACT&quot; &quot;MBL&quot; &quot;ACAT&quot; &quot;CVC&quot; &quot;PAXG&quot; &quot;ARPA&quot; &quot;DRT&quot; ## [10] &quot;DENT&quot; &quot;DAY&quot; &quot;MAN&quot; &quot;IPL&quot; &quot;IHT&quot; &quot;IQ&quot; &quot;MESH&quot; &quot;NAV&quot; &quot;CUR&quot; ## [19] &quot;STORJ&quot; &quot;FDZ&quot; &quot;COCOS&quot; &quot;HTML&quot; &quot;REX&quot; &quot;OAX&quot; &quot;GST&quot; &quot;CND&quot; &quot;DCN&quot; ## [28] &quot;MG&quot; &quot;SWM&quot; &quot;PHX&quot; &quot;CUTE&quot; &quot;BCN&quot; &quot;ELF&quot; &quot;WAXP&quot; &quot;BNK&quot; &quot;CHAT&quot; ## [37] &quot;WIKI&quot; &quot;NEU&quot; &quot;ECA&quot; &quot;JST&quot; &quot;UTT&quot; Now we can remove these symbols from appearing in the dataset: cryptodata &lt;- filter(cryptodata, !(symbol %in% minimum_sd)) In the code above we match all rows where the symbol is part of the minimum_sd object with the list of cryptocurrency symbols to remove from the data, and we then negate the selection using the ! operator to only keep rows with symbols not in the list we found. 4.7 Nest data [ADD HERE] … explain goal and method … First make sure groupings are correct cryptodata &lt;- group_by(cryptodata, symbol, split, training) Example nesting data: nest(cryptodata) ## [90m# A tibble: 680 x 4[39m ## [90m# Groups: symbol, training, split [680][39m ## symbol training split data ## [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;chr&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;list&gt;[39m[23m ## [90m 1[39m XTZ train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [176 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m 2[39m BCH train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [176 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m 3[39m BNB train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [177 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m 4[39m ETC train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [250 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m 5[39m NEO train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [177 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m 6[39m STX train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [152 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m 7[39m BTG train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [268 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m 8[39m LINK train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [198 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m 9[39m VET train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [282 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m10[39m IHF train 1 [90m&lt;tibble [220 × 10]&gt;[39m ## [90m# … with 670 more rows[39m First make training data nested: cryptodata_train &lt;- rename(nest(filter(cryptodata, training==&#39;train&#39;)), train_data = &#39;data&#39;) # Now remove training column cryptodata_train &lt;- select(ungroup(cryptodata_train, training), -training) # Fix issues with individual groups of the data cryptodata_train$train_data &lt;- lapply(cryptodata_train$train_data, na.omit) # Remove elements with no rows after na.omit step.

Give more background on those steps as “catch-alls”?] 4.8 Functional Programming Could work with the data using for loops, which is an “object-oriented” approach. Basically, we could take our given option, iterate through every row of the data, and perform operations on each row and subset of the data we are interested in. That is one approach, but instead we will use a different approach using a “functional programming” approach –&gt; References "],["visualization.html", "Section - 5 Visualization 📉 5.1 Basics - ggplot2 5.2 Using Extensions", " Section - 5 Visualization 📉 Making visualizations using ggplot2 is one of the very best tools available in the R ecosystem. The gg in ggplot2 stands for the Grammar of Graphics, which is essentially the idea that many different types of charts share the same underlying building blocks, and that they can be put together in different ways to make charts that look very different from each other. In Hadley’s own words, “a pie chart is just a bar chart drawn in polar coordinates”, “They look very different, but in terms of the grammar they have a lot of underlying similarities.” 5.1 Basics - ggplot2 So how does ggplot2 actually work? “…in most cases you start with ggplot(), supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with aes()). You then add on layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram()), scales (like scale_colour_brewer()), faceting specifications (like facet_wrap()) and coordinate systems (like coord_flip()).” - ggplot2.tidyverse.org/. Let’s break this down step by step. \"start with ggplot(), supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with aes()) ggplot(data = cryptodata, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) The chart now shows up but is blank because we need to perform an additional step “You then add on layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram())…” We can take the exact same code as above and add + geom_point() ggplot(data = cryptodata, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + # adding geom_point(): geom_point() The most expensive cryptocurrency being shown, BTC in this case, makes it difficult to take a look at any of the other ones. Let’s try zooming-in on a single one by using the same code but making an adjustment to the data parameter to only show data for the cryptocurrency with the symbol ETH, first let’s filter the data down to those results only: eth_data &lt;- subset(cryptodata, symbol == &#39;ETH&#39;) ggplot(data = eth_data, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + geom_point() The axis automatically adjusted to the new data. This is better, but geom_point() might not be the best choice for this chart, let’s change geom_point with geom_line and see what that looks like: ggplot(data = eth_data, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + # changing geom_point() into geom_line(): geom_line() Let’s save the results as an object called crypto_chart: crypto_chart &lt;- ggplot(data = eth_data, aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + geom_line() We can add a linear regression line going through the plot to show the strength of the relationship between the two values. A horizontal line would show a weak relationship, while a sloped line would show a strong one. crypto_chart &lt;- crypto_chart + stat_smooth(method = &#39;lm&#39;) crypto_chart Next, let’s adjust the labels on the chart: crypto_chart &lt;- crypto_chart + ggtitle(&#39;Previous 24h % Price Change Vs. Next 24h Price % Change&#39;, subtitle = max(eth_data$symbol)) + xlab(&#39;Previous 24 hours % Price Change&#39;) + ylab(&#39;Next 24 hours % Price Change&#39;) # display the new chart crypto_chart 5.2 Using Extensions 5.2.1 ggthemes Let’s import a ggplot2 “extension” by importing a package called ggthemes (Arnold 2019) and apply a theme to change the overall look of the chart: # apply the theme &quot;economist&quot; crypto_chart &lt;- crypto_chart + theme_economist() # display the new chart crypto_chart You can find a full list of themes here: https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/ 5.2.2 plotly In some cases, it’s helpful to make a chart responsive to a cursor hovering over it. We can convert any ggplot into an interactive chart by using the plotly (???) package: If you are not looking to convert a ggplot, plotly also provides its own framework for making charts available in R, you can find out more about it here: https://plotly.com/r/ 5.2.3 gganimate We can repeat the same steps on the complete dataset, and then animate the results for each of the groups. Here is the first chart again, animated based on the groupings we created in the previous section: animated_prices &lt;- ggplot(data = mutate(cryptodata, groups=symbol), aes(x = date_time_utc, y = price_usd)) + geom_point() + transition_states(groups) + ggtitle(&#39;Price Over Time&#39;,subtitle = &#39;{closest_state}&#39;) + view_follow() # this adjusts the axis based on the group # Show animation: animated_prices We can slow down the animation by using animate() and choosing the speed in terms of the frames per second (fps)\" animated_prices_result &lt;- animate(animated_prices,fps=1) # show slowed down results animated_prices_result 5.2.4 Calendar Heatmap For this kind of timeseries data, another nice view we can take of the data is a calendar heatmap, by using the package ggTimeSeries (Kothari 2018): calendar_heatmap &lt;- ggplot_calendar_heatmap(eth_data,&#39;date_time_utc&#39;,&#39;price_usd&#39;) #or do target_percent_change here? calendar_heatmap DoW on the y-axis stands for Day Of the Week 5.2.5 Rayshader Awesome!
